# java-editor

- This is an editor with simple tasks and functions under upgrading.

- This project is taken from another repo: (<https://github.com/Sharp-Team/text-editor-javadesk)> and it was edited by me, we add the following design patterns:
  - Command design pattern: Command pattern is a data driven design pattern and falls under behavioral pattern category. A request is wrapped under an object as command and passed to invoker object. Invoker object looks for the appropriate object which can handle this command and passes the command to the corresponding object which executes the command.
      
  - Factory design pattern: Factory pattern is one of the most used design patterns in Java. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object. In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.
